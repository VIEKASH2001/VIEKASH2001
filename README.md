Iâ€™m a **Machine Learning Engineer** on the **ML Infrastructure team** at **SambaNova Systems**, driving high-priority **model bring-ups** and urgent **customer requests**, as well as strategic **ML pipeline automation** and **infrastructure efficiency** initiatives. Collaborating on cross-layer projects, I accelerate end-to-end development velocity on Reconfigurable Dataflow Units (RDUs), deploying **Generative LLMs** (**Language** & **Multimodal**) training, pre-training, fine-tuning, and inferenceâ€”for developers, national laboratories, and private enterprises within critical deadlines over **Cloud** & **On-Perm**. My expertise stems from a funded robotics master's at **Carnegie Mellon University** (CMU) **Robotics** **Institute** - **School of Computer Science** with **Computer Vision** (CV), **Deep Learning** (DL) and **Machine Learning** depth and **Software Engineer** experience at **JBT Corp**. My unwavering commitment to solving complex real-world **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) challenges, coupled with a strong desire to democratize affordable and accessible technology, drives career aspirations in my speciality. Given my strong academic background, prestigious accolades, **5+ years** of extensive practical experience developing industry-relevant solutions in diverse CV, DL and ML global ventures, with **over 9 publications**, combined with my demonstrated track record of soft skills, I am an excellent candidate for a relevant position.

At CMU, I cultivated proficiency in creating practical AI solutions that align seamlessly with business principles while effectively serving client needs. My experience spanned 3 diverse labs, coordinated with **Pitt** and **UPMC** physicians, sponsored by **DoD**, **NSF** and **DARPA**, emphasizing 3 industry-scale AI challenges: 1. Transparency, deployability and resource limitations for AI adoption: **Heuristics-guided explainable AI**; 2. Precision inadequacy in automated robotic interventions: **Physics-informed generative AI**; 3. Vast unlabelled and unstructured training data: **Contrastive unsupervised representation learning**. Moreover, through course projects, I explored enabling shuffled position embeddings in **ResNet-ViT** and **zero-shot visual place recognition** with **foundation models**. Summer of 2023, interning at JBT, collaborating with **ifm**, **Oppent**, and **OSU**, I **integrated** an O3R camera with autonomous vehicle navigation-vision **C++** stack on **edge VPU**, enabling **obstacle detection**, generating requirements, reducing stack lag and streamlining **verification** & **validation** protocols while leveraging **agile** practices, **version control** systems and **CI/CD pipelines**.

Before CMU, several global collaborations with universities: **University of Waterloo**, **NUS**, **ICL** and **CUHK** (exchange study) exposed me to designing industrial automation software: A clinical diagnosis and experimental analysis **app** to aid ophthalmologists and CV-DL frameworks to tackle automation delays in medical imaging (**Graph networks**) and latency in computer-assisted surgery (**Paced curriculum learning** with **knowledge distillation**). My introduction to CV, DL and ML was at **IIT-M**, building sketch query 3D CAD model **CNN** retrieval systems and honed my skillset at **Origin Health Pte. Ltd.**, prototyping in-house **Python GUI** and fetal screening CV-algorithms that piqued VCs. Moreover, I garnered this passion initially, devising a **DL-based EMG-controlled** CPM machine, as an undergraduate instrumentation and control engineer at my university robotics club. These experiences made me industry-ready, equipped with organizational ethos and AI expertise in **signal**, **image**, **video** and **volume** **data**.

My extensive practical experience, robust academic background, accolades, and diverse soft skills make me a valuable asset to any suitable role and I welcome the opportunity to interview. Don't hesitate to contact me for any additional questions or further clarification on my achievements. Thank you for your time and consideration.
