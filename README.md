I'm a funded robotics master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University** (CMU) **Robotics Institute** - **School of Computer Science** with **Computer Vision** (CV), **Deep Learning** (DL) & **Machine Learning** (ML) depth and **Software Engineer Intern** experience at **JBT Corp**. My unwavering commitment to solving complex real-world **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) challenges, coupled with a strong desire to democratize affordable and accessible technology, drives career aspirations in my speciality upon **graduation in May 2024**. Given my strong academic background, prestigious accolades,** 3+** years of extensive practical experience developing industry-relevant solutions in diverse CV, DL and ML global ventures, with **over 8 publications**, combined with my demonstrated track record of soft skills, I am an excellent candidate for a relevant position.

At CMU, I am cultivating expertise in creating practical AI solutions that align seamlessly with business principles while effectively serving client needs. My experience spans 3 diverse labs, coordinated with **Pitt** and **UPMC** physicians, sponsored by **DoD**, **NSF** and **DARPA**, emphasizing 3 industry-scale AI challenges: 1. Transparency, deployability and resource limitations for AI adoption: **Heuristics-guided explainable AI**; 2. Precision inadequacy in automated robotic interventions: **Physics-informed generative AI**; 3. Vast unlabelled and unstructured training data: **Contrastive unsupervised representation learning**. Moreover, through course projects, I explored shuffled position embeddings in **ResNet-ViT** and **zero-shot visual place recognition** with **foundation models** like **DINO**. Summer of 2023, interning at JBT, collaborating with **ifm**, **Oppent**, and **OSU**, I **integrated** an O3R camera with autonomous vehicle navigation-vision **C++** stack on **edge VPU**, enabling obstacle detection, generating requirements, reducing stack lag and streamlining **verification & validation** protocols while leveraging **agile** practices, **version control** systems and **CI/CD pipelines**.

Before CMU, several global collaborations with universities: **UWaterloo**, **NUS**, **ICL** and **CUHK** (exchange study) exposed me to designing industrial automation software: A clinical diagnosis and experimental analysis **app** to aid ophthalmologists and CV-DL frameworks to tackle automation delays in medical imaging (**Graph** **networks**) & latency in computer-assisted surgery (**Paced curriculum learning with knowledge distillation**). 

My introduction to CV, DL & ML was at **IIT-M**, building sketch query 3D CAD model **CNN** retrieval systems and honed my skillset at **Origin Health Pte. Ltd.**, prototyping in-house **Python GUI** and fetal screening CV-algorithms that piqued VCs. Moreover, I garnered this passion firstly initially, devising a **DL-based EMG-controlled** CPM machine, as an undergraduate instrumentation & control engineer at my university robotics club. 

These experiences made me industry-ready, equipped with the organizational ethos and AI expertise in **signal**, **image**, **video** and **volume** data.
