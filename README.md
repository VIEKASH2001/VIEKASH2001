I am a funded master's student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, specializing in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My unwavering commitment to solving complex industrial Artificial Intelligence-powered automation challenges, coupled with a strong desire to democratize affordable and accessible technology, drives career aspirations in my speciality upon graduation in May 2024. To gain relevant experience and further hone my skills, I am actively seeking a summer 2023 internship.
