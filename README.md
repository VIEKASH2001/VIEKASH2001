I am a funded master's student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, specializing in Computer Vision (CV), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML). My unwavering commitment to solving complex industrial Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered automation challenges, coupled with a strong desire to democratize affordable and accessible technology, drives career aspirations in my speciality upon graduation in May 2024. To gain relevant experience and further hone my skills, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity for summer 2023.

At CMU, I am cultivating expertise in creating innovative and practical AI solutions that align seamlessly with business principles while effectively serving client needs. My experience spans three diverse labs, sponsored by DoD and DARPA, emphasizing three distinct industry-scale challenges: precision inadequacy in automated robotic interventions, the issue of vast unlabelled and unstructured training data, and low adoption rates of AI systems due to limitations surrounding their transparency and deployability. 

My initial exposure to designing industrial automation technology with professionals was an association between Sankara Nethralya Eye Hospital and Uwaterloo and, parallelly, as an exchange student at CUHK, partnering with National University Singapore, Shangdong Qilu Hospital, and Imperial College London. These experiences made me industry-ready, equipped with organizational ethos, particularly collaborative with DEI values, socially responsible, quality-focused and results-oriented. 

I laid my CV, DL and ML foundation at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and honed my skillset at Origin Health Pte. Ltd., Singapore. Moreover, I garnered a passion for my specialization as an undergraduate engineer at my university robotics club. Serving as the Vice President R&D helped me understand stakeholder requirements and refine my business acumen, playing a big role in further leadership at symposiums and the international relations office. Furthermore, I enhanced my communication and interpersonal skills as a Toastmaster, critical thinking and strategic planning abilities as a national chess player, and adaptability as a teaching assistant at CMU.

Given my strong academic background, scholarship awards, extensive practical experience developing industry-relevant solutions in diverse CV, DL and ML labs, with over 6 publications, combined with my demonstrated track record of soft skills, including leadership and collaboration, I am an excellent candidate for a relevant position.
